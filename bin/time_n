=head1 SYNOPSIS

 time_n -n 5 perl -I lib -e 'do stuff'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Run it (default is five times) and report child process user & system
CPU times.

This is an incomplete hack, just enough for now.

It seems to have worse precision than the Bash built-in C<time> .  I
have C<CONFIG_HZ=250> .
